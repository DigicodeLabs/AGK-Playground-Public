# AGK Playground
This is the public repository (issues only) for AGK Playground which is a tool written in AGK (AppGameKit) to be used along-side AGK. AGK Playground lets you experiment with different parts of AGK in real time, and then export the code into your own projects/games. You can currently play with 2D Particles, sprites orbiting with Sin/Cos, Sin waves, and tweens.

# Future of AGK Playground
This tool was created for a jam on itch.io, and while the jam ran for about 28 days, it just wasn't enough time to get everything I wanted in, and the code was also rushed.

I plan to re-write it and develop it further, so if you like the current version of the tool, and have features you'd want to see, or feedback on what's currently available then please create an issue here on this repository. Any feedback, suggestions, and bug reporting will help a lot with the future development of this tool.
